## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. 

## Disclaimer
In the examples of the book, the First Person and Third Person templates are used a lot. Epic Games modified these templates. These changes do not affect the examples that create new Blueprints, but affect the examples that modify the Blueprints of these templates.

Part 2 and part 3 (chapters 5 to 12) of the book consist of the step-by-step development of a game based on the First Person template.

The recommendation is to get the chapter 5 project from the source code and keep following the book using this project until chapter 12, because you will find in the project everything that is shown in the images of the book.



**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for anyone interested in developing games or applications with UE5. Although basic knowledge of Windows OS is required, experience in programming or UE5 is not necessary.
